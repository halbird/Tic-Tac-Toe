# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game.  

Assignment from Udemy course Complete Python Bootcamp.  

Two player game of tic-tac-toe. Player one is asked to choose a row and column to place their symbol (O goes first). Numbers are 1-index. Turn alternated between player 1 and 2. O or X is placed in the designated point each turn until a player has 3 in a row or neither player wins. Player cannot place their symbol where there is already a symbol, and they cannot choose a row or column not on the board. If they submit an invalid input, they are asked to try again. 

To-dos:
* Fix bugs that are difficult to simulate (output no on wins when the board is not filled)
* Add option for players to choose who has which symbol
* Choice of which player goes first
* Statistics of number of games won by each player (also affects who goes first next game)
* Add option to play again
* Add difficulty levels with more than 3 columns/rows?
